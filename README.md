## Intro
This is an app that represents an example of event receiver. The event mgmt. technology used is Azure Event Grid. 
You can trigger an event from the Azure Logic App or a database and observe for it to appear in the Event Grid (in a respective topic).

## Setup
- Make sure the latest .NET 6 SDK is installed (the IDE does not matter)
- Register an account on https://ngrok.com/ and install it locally (make sure it can be executed via the command line, i.e., it should be added to Windows Env. variables). Complete local installation with connecting to an account (registering with token, as per instruction on their website)
- Run the client app with `dotnet watch run`
- If there were no changes to 'launchSettings.json', run 'ngrok' with the following parameters in a separate console window `ngrok http https://localhost:5001 --host-header="localhost:5001"`
- Copy forwarding URL generated by `ngrok` that should be ending with `.ngrok.io`
- Add new subscription in the Event Grid Topic (of 'Webhook' type). The endpoint would be a generated ngrok forwarding address + `/api/Events`. Ex.: ` https://b9ae-99-246-37-169.ngrok.io/api/Events`

# Expected result
Upon the event activation (either via the Logic App or data insert in the Database), you should observe the event appearing in the respective topic, as well as the console app. The processing delay is 1 min (due to the database trigger specifics).
